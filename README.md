This project is a simple Hospital Management System developed using Java and MySQL.
The main goal of this project was to practice core Java concepts and learn how to connect a Java application with a MySQL database using JDBC.

💡 Key Features
Core Java Concepts: Classes, objects, methods, control structures, exception handling.

Database Integration: Full CRUD operations using JDBC to interact with a MySQL database.

SQL Queries: Inserting, selecting, and validating data from patients, doctors, and appointments tables.

Error Handling: Basic SQL exception handling implemented.

Formatted Output: Clean tabular display for patients and doctors using formatted System.out.printf printing.


🔥 Final Note
This project primarily focuses on learning how Java applications communicate with databases through JDBC while keeping the code structure simple and easy to understand.
